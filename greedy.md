Greedy Algorithms
=================
Here are some problems can be solved using a greedy strategy. A greedy approach
takes the best action immediately at each step; thus it is fast. However, it
may not always yield the correct result since the algorithm can be
"short-sighted" and produce a suboptimal answer. When solving those problems,
we need to convince ourselves the correctness of the greedy algorithms.
