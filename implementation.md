Implementation
==============
This is a class of problems where the problem-solving strategy is trivial or
given as part of the problem statement. The challenge for the programmers is to
implement the strategy correctly for all cases. Different ways of modeling the
problem or different code structures may affect the complexity: a well-designed
structure not only makes the code more reable but also makes the solution much
shorter (takes less time to type).
